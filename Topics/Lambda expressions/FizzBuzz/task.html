<h2>FizzBuzz</h2>
<p>FizzBuzz is a children's game to learn division. You are given a range of numbers, and you are to count incrementally. Although, when a number is divisible by 3, you should say "fizz", and when a number is divisible by 5, you should say "buzz". When both conditions are true for a number, you should say "fizzbuzz".</p>

<p>Take a look at the piece of code below that solves this task for the range from 1 to 100:</p>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun fizzbuzz(from: Int, to: Int, transformation: (Int) -&gt; String) {
    for (number in from..to) {
        println(transformation(number))
    }
}

fun main() {
    fizzbuzz(1, 100) { number -&gt;
        if (number % 15 == 0) {
            ___ "fizzbuzz"
        }
        if (number % 3 == 0) {
            ___ "fizz"
        }
        if (number % 5 == 0) {
            ___ "buzz"
        }
        ___ number.toString()
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>What should you write instead of the gaps to return the answer from the lambda?</p>
